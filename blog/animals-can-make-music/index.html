<p>First of all, sorry about embedded videos.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t remember first time I listened the very first Animal Collective song. But I guess it was weird, maybe I just trashed it after some seconds. It don&rsquo;t surprise me, like many complex music kind, you have to train your ears and your mind.</p>

<p>But in fact, I think this band deliver a very basic emotion. An emotion that just make you want to cry, move your head and just smile.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then I go and take some pills
Cause I cant do all of my do&rsquo;s and still feel ill
You get that WOOOO!</p>

<p>If you never listen Animal collective I think there is a song that you have to start with. It will show you some emotional works.</p>

<p>These guys, mostly Panda Bear and Avey Tare at their beginnings wasn&rsquo;t good musicians at my ears in a sense of music complexity. But they have the ability to give you same raw emotion that you can have in music composition mind state. You&rsquo;ll be probably not familiar with this kind of music, but stay here.</p>

<p>After many listen of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_They%27re_Gone,_Spirit_They%27ve_Vanished">Spirit They&rsquo;re Gone, Spirit They&rsquo;ve Vanished</a>, I just don&rsquo;t understand how I can say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[..] wasn&rsquo;t good musicians [..]</p>

<p><cite>Myself previous paragraph</cite></p>

<p>Nevermind, let&rsquo;s continue.</p>

<p>Energy of this music cheating you. You think there is a bunch of sound effect to produce it, but this emotion is raw. Just listen same song in acoustic to understand what I mean. Please, don&rsquo;t stop at the middle of the music, reward is mainly at the end.</p>

<p>Maybe you dislike how this fucking unkown guy scream in your ears, this give me chills.</p>

<p>Each time I listen and watch this video I saw a young little boy smiling and crying at the same time.</p>

<p>If you feel curious, I advice you to start with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merriweather_Post_Pavilion_(album)">Merriweather Post Pavilion</a> album. It&rsquo;s their must <em>pop</em> and easy to listen album. Just force you to listen it, maybe 2, 3 or more times. You&rsquo;ll start to understand the mean of this band.</p>

<p>After that, you&rsquo;ll have many many other albums to discorver, different facets.</p>

<p>Can you measure music <strong>greatness</strong> with it&rsquo;s complexity ? Emotion ? Capacity to send you stuff ?</p>

<p>Have you ever cried not about the mix of context and music, but just cause of music ?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m this guy that close eyes, move head and smile in bus next to you. Don&rsquo;t be worry, I&rsquo;m a cool guy, just full of emotion.</p>

<p>This live session is a energy ball that just explode in you, this is magic. Thank you, Animal Collective.</p>

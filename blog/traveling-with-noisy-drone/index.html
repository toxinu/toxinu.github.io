<h1>Traveling with Noisy drone</h1>
    <span class="small">Posted on 22 May 2014</span>

    <div><p>I really enjoy <em>electro/drone/experimental</em> music.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boards_of_Canada">Boards of Canada</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a>, return to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Fennesz">Fennesz</a> and finish with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin">Aphex Twin</a>.</p>
<p>These guys are explorer, they try to take you away in their world.
I want to write something because there are two recent albums that make sure that
I love music exploration, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgins_(Tim_Hecker_album)">Virgin</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> and A U R O R A by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a>.</p>
<p>For me exploration means that every part of the adventure won't be enjoyable but it's an experimentation. Like when you just travel, you'll walk an hour and hour to reach the top of the mountain. It could be difficult, but when you reach your goal or just understand why you are here, it's enjoyable. I think you can apply this to music. Music is not just entertainment, it's research, travel, bad or good.</p>

<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->This album is not out for now (release is May, 26) , if you want to listen it, you'll have to retrieve it from Pirate Bay from example and buy it if you enjoy this album.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Just listen to <em>Secant</em> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a> (A U R O R A), you'll take hard industrial beats
during 3 minutes, next part is like emotionally high explosion but it will hurt you at same time. It's like a small light in a very unhealthy dark hole full of spikes. <em>Diphenyl Oxalate</em> (next track) is pure noise, that is good for you. I agree to say that Ben Frost is a hard <em>electro/experimental/noise</em> artist to understand, this guy just do an absolutely large amount of work, and not just music. If you can't understand him for now, please, keep reading.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Fennesz">Christian Fennesz</a> is an experimental guitar artist in electronic music. Some of his work is easier to appreciate, understand them. Ben Frost sound is more <em>modern</em> in different points, it's hard to explain. Just forget previous artist for now. If you come from <strong>ambient</strong> world you'll probably enjoy his work. Drop your ears to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWAghDS6s4Q&amp;list=PLKtI6DyKnYmNmVOGTz0wTki0kiLHVpdi5">Venice</a>&lsquo;s (Youtube) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Fennesz">Fennesz</a> album. Okay, is it better than Ben Frost ? Will you stay here ?</p>
<p>Notable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin">Aphex Twin</a> have done some drone stuff in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Ambient_Works_Volume_II">Selected Ambient Works Volume 2</a>, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwH1KSAIVH4">Tassels</a> (Youtube). It's easy stuff to listen, no aggressive sounds but not easy to appreciate. Yes Aphex Twin have done some drone sounds, this guy have just done such a bunch of stuff.</p>
<p>Famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boards_of_Canada">Boards Of Canada</a> band, is not very far away from noise sound, try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZHS52l-4Nw">Corsair</a> (Youtube).</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Next step, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> is a Canadian artist who have recently release for me one his best album, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgins_(Tim_Hecker_album)">Virgin</a>. But wait! I advice you to listen older stuff, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE9mT4JaW_0">The Piano Drop</a> (Youtube). You guy, if you really enjoy it, you just found an amount stuff to work on. I agree to say that with Tim Hecker we add a small amount of what we can call <em>noise</em>, but for me it's a tool to expand to rich emotional music behind it. I can only advice you to drop your ass in a great sofa, put a headphone, close your eyes and listen to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravedeath,_1972">Ravedeath, 1972</a> (Wikipedia). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> is that guy, that really allow me to discover what is drone/noise/experimental electro music. You can find more stuff, under the name of Jetone, just go to Wikipedia. When you'll familiar with this sound, open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgins_(Tim_Hecker_album)">Virgin</a>, latest Tim Hecker album. It's just a masterpiece, really.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>At least, return to older <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a> stuff, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fy4YPd7viU">Theory of Machines</a> and try to recognize that you are just fucking traveling since to beginning of this post. Exploration.</p>
<p>You can make great combos. If you read my previous post, you are aware that I'm reading <em>Lovecraft</em> stuff, horror exploration books with this kind of music is awesome. Another idea is to sleep while listening to this stuff. Try it.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

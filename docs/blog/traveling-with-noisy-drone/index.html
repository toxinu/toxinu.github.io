<h1>Traveling with Noisy drone</h1>
    <span class="small">Posted on 22 May 2014</span>

    <div><p>I really enjoy <em>electro/drone/experimental</em> music.</p>

<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boards_of_Canada">Boards of Canada</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a>, return to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Fennesz">Fennesz</a> and finish with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin">Aphex Twin</a>.</p>

<p>These guys are explorer, they try to take you away in their world.
I want to write something because there are two recent albums that make sure that
I love music exploration, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgins_(Tim_Hecker_album)">Virgin</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> and A U R O R A by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a>.</p>

<p>For me exploration means that every part of the adventure won&rsquo;t be enjoyable but it&rsquo;s an experimentation. Like when you just travel, you&rsquo;ll walk an hour and hour to reach the top of the mountain. It could be difficult, but when you reach your goal or just understand why you are here, it&rsquo;s enjoyable. I think you can apply this to music. Music is not just entertainment, it&rsquo;s research, travel, bad or good.</p>

<p><img alt="Ben Frost - A U R O R A" style="margin-left:8px;float:right" src="/images/posts/ben_frost_aurora.jpg" /></p>

<p><small>This album is not out for now (release is May, 26) , if you want to listen it, you&rsquo;ll have to retrieve it from Pirate Bay from example and buy it if you enjoy this album.</small></p>

<p>Just listen to <em>Secant</em> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a> (A U R O R A), you&rsquo;ll take hard industrial beats
during 3 minutes, next part is like emotionally high explosion but it will hurt you at same time. It&rsquo;s like a small light in a very unhealthy dark hole full of spikes. <em>Diphenyl Oxalate</em> (next track) is pure noise, that is good for you. I agree to say that Ben Frost is a hard <em>electro/experimental/noise</em> artist to understand, this guy just do an absolutely large amount of work, and not just music. If you can&rsquo;t understand him for now, please, keep reading.</p>

<p><img alt="Fennesz - Venice" style="margin-right:8px;float:left" src="/images/posts/fennesz_venice.jpg" /></p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Fennesz">Christian Fennesz</a> is an experimental guitar artist in electronic music. Some of his work is easier to appreciate, understand them. Ben Frost sound is more <em>modern</em> in different points, it&rsquo;s hard to explain. Just forget previous artist for now. If you come from <strong>ambient</strong> world you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy his work. Drop your ears to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWAghDS6s4Q&amp;list=PLKtI6DyKnYmNmVOGTz0wTki0kiLHVpdi5">Venice</a>&rsquo;s (Youtube) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Fennesz">Fennesz</a> album. Okay, is it better than Ben Frost ? Will you stay here ?</p>

<p>Notable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphex_Twin">Aphex Twin</a> have done some drone stuff in his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selected_Ambient_Works_Volume_II">Selected Ambient Works Volume 2</a>, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwH1KSAIVH4">Tassels</a> (Youtube). It&rsquo;s easy stuff to listen, no aggressive sounds but not easy to appreciate. Yes Aphex Twin have done some drone sounds, this guy have just done such a bunch of stuff.</p>

<p>Famous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boards_of_Canada">Boards Of Canada</a> band, is not very far away from noise sound, try <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZHS52l-4Nw">Corsair</a> (Youtube).</p>

<p><img alt="Tim Hecker - Ravedeath, 1972" style="margin-left:8px;float:right" src="/images/posts/tim_hecker_ravedeath_1972.jpg" /></p>

<p>Next step, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> is a Canadian artist who have recently release for me one his best album, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgins_(Tim_Hecker_album)">Virgin</a>. But wait! I advice you to listen older stuff, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EE9mT4JaW_0">The Piano Drop</a> (Youtube). You guy, if you really enjoy it, you just found an amount stuff to work on. I agree to say that with Tim Hecker we add a small amount of what we can call <em>noise</em>, but for me it&rsquo;s a tool to expand to rich emotional music behind it. I can only advice you to drop your ass in a great sofa, put a headphone, close your eyes and listen to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ravedeath,_1972">Ravedeath, 1972</a> (Wikipedia). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Hecker">Tim Hecker</a> is that guy, that really allow me to discover what is drone/noise/experimental electro music. You can find more stuff, under the name of Jetone, just go to Wikipedia. When you&rsquo;ll familiar with this sound, open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgins_(Tim_Hecker_album)">Virgin</a>, latest Tim Hecker album. It&rsquo;s just a masterpiece, really.</p>

<p><center><hr></center></p>

<p>At least, return to older <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Frost_(musician)">Ben Frost</a> stuff, like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fy4YPd7viU">Theory of Machines</a> and try to recognize that you are just fucking traveling since to beginning of this post. Exploration.</p>

<p>You can make great combos. If you read my previous post, you are aware that I&rsquo;m reading <em>Lovecraft</em> stuff, horror exploration books with this kind of music is awesome. Another idea is to sleep while listening to this stuff. Try it.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

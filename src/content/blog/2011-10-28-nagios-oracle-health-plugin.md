This is more a memo than an article. A quick and dirty [check_oracle_health][1] plugin installation, with prerequires.

Developped by [Gerhard Lausser][2], an active [Shinken][3] developper with [Jean Gab√®s][4].

Like most of Nagios plugins, it's in Perl language and it's use DBD::Oracle module, and this module need an Oracle client.

## Oracle Instant Client

You have to create a fucking Oracle account... Yes I know you think :

_"What's this great article ?! Proprietary software are just awesome!"_.

Go to [Oracle Instant Client Downloads Page][5]. Get the __Instant Client Package - Basic__ and __sdk__.
Or use my personnal [links][6] above.

For the story, i have fucked my brain during three hours cause I have download the __Instant Client Package - Basic Lite__ and try to work with a Western American charset database... And of course, Basic Lite does not support it.

Derp.

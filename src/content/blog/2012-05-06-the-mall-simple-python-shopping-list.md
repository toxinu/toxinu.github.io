Am I serious ?

The plan is to create a simple Python todo list mainly for shopping list with mobile interface. It's was the objectif.

__Tools box__:

 * Python
 * Flask
 * Twitter bootstrap
 * Json

__Description__

 * Simple authentification
 * Very light design
 * Mobile design (responsive)
 * Very very light Todo List
 * In fact, looks like a Shopping List

You can see project page [here][2].
And this is my personnal [Shopping list][3] if you want a quick look.

__Quick Installation__

{{< highlight bash >}}
pip install Flask
cd /var/www
git clone https://github.com/Socketubs/TheMall.git TheMall
cd TheMall
python main.py
{{< /highlight >}}

__Next__

Definitely nothing, I think.
I have no idea just now but I'm totaly open.

And the __door__ is [here][4].

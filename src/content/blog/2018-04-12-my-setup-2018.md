## Tips & notes

- To directly run *tmux* with *alacritty* you can edit your `DesktopEntry` like that:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/toxinu/42950e9a91ba1f0141e569fc3018dc15.js"></script>

- Use Visual Code Studio from [FlatHub](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.visualstudio.code) to have a Microsoft-free compiled binary. Because binaries given by Microsoft are not open source.
- My dotfiles are on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/toxinu/dotfiles).
- I don't have standing desk, but I have a nice seat. My back never hurts.
- My [terminal](https://gitlab.com/toxinu/dotfiles/blob/29279988ebf8fe9387ae2ecc3f2fea571f95794e/.config/alacritty/alacritty.yml#L90-115) and [editor](https://github.com/gerane/VSCodeThemes/tree/master/gerane.Theme-Ascetic) have grey & white (monochrome for editor) colorschemes. I advize you to try it if you have regular headcaches.
- I'm self hosting some services like: [Shaarli](https://github.com/shaarli/Shaarli), [TinyTinyRss](https://tt-rss.org/), [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/), [RSS-Bridge](https://github.com/RSS-Bridge/rss-bridge) and more.

The most important part, buy a nebulizer diffuser it's amazing. My favorite essential oils are "Pepper mint", "Tea tree" & "Niaouli".
